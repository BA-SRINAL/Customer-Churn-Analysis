# Customer-Churn-Analysis

# Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical issue in the telecom industry, where retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of customer churn for "Databel," a telecom company, using a dataset that includes customer demographics, interactions, service usage, and churn reasons. The objective was to uncover key insights that could help "Databel" reduce churn and improve customer retention strategies.

# Problem Statement

The dataset provided by "Databel" contains detailed information about customer demographics, interactions, service usage, and churn reasons. The challenge was to analyze this data to understand the churn patterns and identify actionable insights to help the company reduce its churn rate.

# Objective

The primary objectives of this project were:
1. To calculate the overall churn rate for "Databel."
2. To identify the top reasons for customer churn.
3. To analyze the demographic and usage patterns associated with high churn rates.
4. To develop strategies to retain at-risk customer segments.
   
# Tools & Technologies Used

1. Google Sheets: For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
2. Pivot Tables: For aggregating and summarizing the data.
3. Dashboard Creation: Multiple sheets were used to create a comprehensive and interactive dashboard that presented the analysis in a visually appealing manner.

# Data Cleaning & Preparation

1. Handling Missing Data: I identified and filled in missing values where appropriate, or excluded them from the analysis when necessary.
2. Standardizing Data Formats: Ensured consistency in data formats across all columns, particularly for dates and categorical variables.
3. Filtering Irrelevant Data: Removed any data points that were not relevant to the churn analysis to focus on meaningful insights.

# Data Visualization

1. Interactive Dashboard: Multiple sheets were used to create an interactive dashboard that allows stakeholders to explore the data across various dimensions, such as demographics, service usage, and churn reasons.
2. Visual Elements: Included bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs to represent churn rates, customer demographics, and churn reasons visually.

# Insights & Impact

1. Retention Strategies: Developed targeted strategies to retain at-risk customer segments, such as senior citizens.
2. Contract Recommendations: Suggested specific contract types that could help reduce churn, particularly for customers with high churn rates.
3. Churn Reduction: The insights from this analysis can be used to reduce churn rates and improve customer loyalty, ultimately driving better business outcomes.
